# SkurkyMello for the browser: firmware/src/dinghy.c compiled to WebAssembly on web/app/web_host.c (the page's FM-1)
# instead of the chip: build/web/skurkymello.wasm, no imports, no C library. clang with the wasm32 target and wasm-ld
# (lld): apt install clang lld. (No such clang here, as on a Mac? Any Docker image with both will do:
# docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w IMAGE sh web/app/build.sh). After Star Distroyer's web/app/build.sh.
